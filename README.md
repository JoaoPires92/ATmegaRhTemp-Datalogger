Main Caracteristics & Hardware:
- Atmega 2560 microprocessor.
- Real time clock.
-2.8‚Äù LCD touch screen
- Tem & Hum Sensor: AM2302 DHT22
- 2x Relay Output
- Maximum and minimum temperature&Humidity configuration to control the outputs
- 2x programmed outputs where days of the week and duration period (Hours and Minutes) can be selected to control these outputs.
- Graph of daily temperature&Humidity records.
- Internal table of temperature records where it is possible to check 4 records per hour for 24 hours.
- Mini SD memory card to store temperature&Humidity records with a recording period that can be configured with the capacity to store up to thousands of records depending on the desired size of the SD card.
- EventsDownloader application for Windows where the same records can be downloaded. (This is a separate vb.net desktop application to download all events to the laptop)
